# cookiecutter-pyproject
@kwierman's Custom Python Project Boilerplate

## Requirements

~~~ bash
pip install cookiecutter
~~~

## Usage

~~~ bash
 cookiecutter gh:kwierman/cookiecutter-pyproject
~~~

## Purpose

This replaces a lot of the needless overhead of creating new python projects. Honestly, this is geared towards my own development workflow, but if it works for you, go for it.
